## Background & Objectives

A challenge to get you familiar with Bootstrap CSS classes:

- utilities classes (`.text-center`, `.list-inline`, etc..)
- basic CSS classes (`.btn-primary`, `.form-inline`, etc..)
- UI components classes (`.navbar`)

## Specs

In this challenge, reproduce [this page](http://lewagon.github.io/bootstrap-challenges/01-bootstrap-components/) by using Bootstrap classes as much as possible. Every time you need to style something, look in the Bootstrap documentation if there is a class for that. Here are some instructions to help you in this challenge:

- Find and build all your graphical elements first (background image, SVG icons). For icons [NounProject](http://thenounproject.com/) and [IconMelon](http://iconmelon.com/) are nice options. Don't hesitate to modify a bit the SVG icons with Sketch to add your own flavor.
- For the banner and footer, you will have to write a bit of personal CSS, as there is no Bootstrap class for image of custom color backgrounds.
- The [Bootsrap navbar code](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar-default) given in the documentation is a bit too complicated and not very adapted (the left upper brand is not an image but a text..). Use [our own navbar code](https://github.com/lewagon/awesome-navbars/blob/master/templates/_navbar.html) instead, it's better!
